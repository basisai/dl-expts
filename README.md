## Demos
The demos can be viewed from the [App](https://powerful-hamlet-55050.herokuapp.com/).

To add a demo to the app,
- create a folder with the script to run the demo in Streamlit, together with any data used.
- update `app.py` by including a page.
- deploy the app.

## Notes
- There is no official PyTorch base image, so use TensorFlow-GPU base image and install PyTorch.
